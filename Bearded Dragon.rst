**Bearded Dragon (**\ *Pogona vitticeps*\ **)** **Care Sheet**

The bearded dragon is a very fun, and rewarding companion for the person
who puts the time in. They are relatively easy going, easy to care for,
and loving. They will thrive with attention, and enjoy your company.
Please note, reptiles are not like humans. They do not “have emotions”
as such, however, we have found that each have their own personality,
and do, at times, enjoy/seek out human attention. Each dragon is very
unique, and will each have their own behavior and temperament.

-  Lighting

   -  UV-B Tube Light (Arcadia 12%, Reptisun 10%). The percentage listed
      with the bulb, is the amount of UVB provided by the light. This
      light should span approximately ¾ of the tank.

   -  Heat Lamp/Basking Lamp

   -  Ceramic Heat Emitter (optional, but recommended)

-  Substrate Options

   -  Absolutely no sand (this is debated, but we do not feel it is
      worth the risk)

   -  Ceramic/Slate tile, with a slight texture (bonus: it will help
      file down the dragons nails)

   -  Repticarpet

   -  Paper Towel

-  Tank Requirements

   -  While it may be safe to start a dragon in a 20 gallon long,
      eventually a 40 gallon breeder, or larger, will be required.
      Bearded Dragons are a land based animal, and prefer floor space,
      not height.

   -  Hide

   -  Basking Spot (log, tree, etc)

   -  Cold side should be approximately 85-90F

   -  Hot Side should be approximately 100F

   -  Basking spot should reach approximately 110F for juveniles, 100F
      for adults.

   -  If tank temperatures drop below 70/75F, you will need to add a
      Ceramic Heat Emitter to help bring the temperatures up

   -  A temperature gun, as well as two thermometers, are highly
      recommended (the gun to check basking temperature, and
      thermometers for general temperature).

-  Feeding

   -  Dragons will accept a large variety of foods. Juvenile dragons
      should eat smaller insects 2-3 times a day, and vegetables 3 times
      a week. All food should be dusted with calcium

   -  Adult dragons will move to an 80% vegetable diet, still getting
      all food dusted

Below is a short list of vegetables that are safe for Dragons. Please
note, this list is not exhaustive, and should be researched further.
Greens should always be available, regardless of the dragons age.

-  Turnip Greens

-  Mustard Greens

-  Bok Choy

-  Collard Greens

Fruits can be provided, but should be a treat, rather than a staple

-  Blueberries

-  Apples

-  Peaches

Calcium

-  Rep-Cal Calcium

-  Rep-Cal Calcium with D3 Vitamin

-  Suggested Dusting Schedule

   -  Monday/Thursday: Calcium Without D3

   -  Tuesday/Friday: Calcium with D3

   -  Wednesday/Saturday: Multivitamin

   -  Sunday: Calcium (Optional)

Insects are absolutely important, and should be gutloaded prior to
feeding (provide with the same types of veggies your dragon would eat).
Crickets are a favorite, however, they have been known to carry
parasites. Preference should be given to Dubia Roaches, as they are
higher in protein, and are very easy to raise at home. In addition,
Super Worms are another insect that can become a staple in your dragon
diet.

Before you purchase and/or adopt a dragon, please be certain that you
have a vet that will see reptiles. If you need to be provided
information for a vet, please contact Scaly Vale Herp Rescue
(matt@scalyvaleherprescue.org), and we can refer you to a vet in your
area.
